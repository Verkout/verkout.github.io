        <meta name="description" content="🔥EASY HIIT! BEGINNER FRIENDLY!🔥 from @pippasykes: Goooood morning everyone! I hope you’re having a lovely week so far! I’m absolutely loving life in the sun today! What’s your day like today?

Today’s workout is an EASY HIIT routine that is suitable for all levels, including beginners! There is no jumping involved, but you can add a jump here & there to up the intensity if you fancy it!

🔥LISTENING TO YOUR BODY!🔥.
Some days, you may not feel like doing a massively sweaty workout, but still want to get your body moving. That’s okay! Even if you don’t want to move your body, that’s okay too! Our bodies know when they’re too tired, so if you’re feeling tired, then let yourself rest! One day won’t make a difference! Especially with lockdown, motivation for everyone is quite low (unless you have a home gym), but the gyms are opening soon! Let’s look forward to that!
