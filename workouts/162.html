        <meta name="description" content="More with Less KB Workout from @rebecca.rouse: Where in the past I felt I needed an entire gym full of people and equipment to get an effective workout, I now have an immense appreciation for the simplicity of training alone, outside, barefoot in the grass, with just one single kettlebell.

Both have their place and unique benefits, absolutely. But I'm glad that the past 12 months have shifted my perspective on many things and required me to be more adaptable - not just in fitness, but in all aspects of life." />
