        <meta name="description" content="HIIT Cardio Workout from @thesweatmovement: HIIT Cardio, I love it, I hate it, I love-hate it. Ya know? It the type of movement that has your heart feeling like its seriously going to pop out of your chest. So its great for improving your cardiovascular and metabolic health, not to mention decreasing body fat. It’s also the style of exercise that I can never do when Jasmine is sleeping, haha, its a lot of jumping and really loud.

If today’s your self care day, ENJOYYYYY that and save this workout for something to try in the week." />
