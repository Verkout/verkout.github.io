        <meta name="description" content="Phase SiX Strength + Mobility Workout from @jay.rose.phase6: The unstable nature of the soft sand brought a whole other level of intensity to these 3 movements! Jeeeeezzuuusss!!!

Combining these #bodyweight exercises will also work to build #strength + #mobility at the same time as well as improve your agility and ground based locomotion!


While these movements origins can be traced back to and implemented regularly into many forms of #martialarts (particularly #jiujitsu and wrestling), this workout can be translated over to any form of training regardless of your practice or sport!
—
Better yet, no equipment required so it can be done anywhere, at anytime!
