        <meta name="description" content="KB Timed Interval Training🥵 from @cameronharn: This workout was an absolute smoker. Simple & effective🔥🔥 

Timed Ladder with 1:1 work to rest ratio.

A training principle that I frequently like to use in my programs is a principle known as Peripheral Heart Action (PHA). PHA is a style of circuit training where you move from one exercise to the next, with minimal rest, while alternating between upper and lower body exercises. 
When we are breaking up the workload between the upper and lower body, we get a stronger hit on the cardiovascular system because the heart has to work harder to pump blood between the lower extremities and the upper extremities. 

The net effect of this style of training is: increased calorie burn, enhancement of aerobic capacity, and muscle endurance. " />
